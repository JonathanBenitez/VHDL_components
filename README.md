# VHDL_components
Standard components for VHDL code
- To be able to use bit8_componets you need bit4_components and components as well
- To be able to use bit4_components you need Components as well

# bit8_components are for 8 bit inputs components
Includes
- adder
- multiplier
- incrementer
- decrementer

# bit4_components are for 4 bit inputs components 
Inludes
- adder
- multiplier
- incrementer
- decrementer

# componets are for single bit inputs components
Includes
- full adder
- half adder
- full subtractor
- half subtractor
- debouncer
- falling edge detector
- rising edge detector

# Testbench includes testbenches for all components
