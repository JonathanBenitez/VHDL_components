# VHDL_components
This VHDL code is for some different kinds of components that are often used to make circuits. The question is why do this instead of just inbuilt VHDL functions? Well, I don't know but I wanted to make a circuit completely from scratch and this project is made so that if you want to do the same, or want to know how ta make different circuits than use this code and don't waste your time like I did.

# To be able to run correctly
- To be able to use bit8_componets you need bit4_components and components as well
- To be able to use bit4_components you need Components as well

# bit8_components are for 8 bit inputs components
Includes
- adder
- subtractor
- multiplier
- incrementer
- decrementer

# bit4_components are for 4 bit inputs components 
Inludes
- adder
- subtractor
- multiplier
- incrementer
- decrementer

# componets are for single bit inputs components
Includes
- full adder
- half adder
- full subtractor
- half subtractor
- debouncer
- falling edge detector
- rising edge detector

# Multiplexer are for different kinds of Multiplexers
Includes
- 2 to 1 multiplexer
- 4 to 1 multiplexer
- 8 to 1 multiplexer
- 16 to 1 multiplexer
- 4 to 2 multiplexer
- 8 to 2 multiplexer
- 8 to 4 multiplexer
- 16 to 4 multiplexer

# Testbench includes testbenches for all components
Testbenches are done through testing every possible combination
